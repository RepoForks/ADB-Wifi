# ADB-Wifi
A script to auto connect to android devices in debug mode using WIFI

## Motivation
Every day I need to connect to a lot of diferent devices to debug applications.
Some devices are USB2 and others USB3 and I lose plugging the devices adn waiting for the debug.
So, I create this script to auto connect to a device using WIFI. The script save the connections in a configuration file to try reconnect when you reboot your computer.

## Usage
```bash
python2.7 adb_wifi.py
```
